## Angular 2.0 component syntax for Meteor 1.1 and AngularJS

This library allows you to continue using Angular 1.3 or higher, while giving you the opportunity to start coding your Angular 1 applications in Angular 2 syntax. You get to keep your investment in Angular 1 while preparing for Angular 2.  

If either of the statements below applies to you, then you need angular2-now:

- You are about to start a new development in Angular 1 and are thinking about migrating to Angular 2, when it finally arrives.

- You just like the clean syntax of Angular 2, but don't care much for the rest of Angular 2 at this stage.

You are welcome to contribute to this project.

### What's implemented?

The following annotations have been implemented to support the Angular 2.0 component syntax, as far as possible.

- **@Component** `({ selector: 'tag-name', bind: { a: '=', etc: '@' }, injectables: ['$http', myServiceClass] })`
- **@View** `({ template: '<div>Inline template</div>', templateUrl: 'pth/to/template.html'})`
- **@Inject** `(['$http', myServiceClass, '$q'])` or `('$http', myServiceClass, '$q')
- **bootstrap** `(app [, config ])` 
- **SetModule** `('my-app', ['angular-meteor'])`

The annotations below are not Angular 2, as such, but for me they make coding in Angular a bit nicer. 

- **@Service** `({ name: 'serviceName' })`
- **@Filter** `({ name: 'filterName' })`
- **@State** `({name: 'stateName', ?url: '/stateurl', ?defaultRoute: true/false or '/default/route/url', ?resolve: {...}, ?controller: controllerFunction, ?template: { }, ?html5Mode: true/false }))`

The annotation below will only work with Meteor.

- **@MeteorMethod** `( ?options )`

### Code demos

You may want to see the following github repositories for some examples of usage, before you start coding. It could save you some "WTF" time.

### Can I use this library outside of Meteor?

Yes, you can. The angular2-now.js library works with both ES6 (Babel) and plain ES5.
 
Here is an ES6 example [ES6 Angular2-now](http://plnkr.co/edit/JhHlOr?p=preview). Also, there are examples in this README and in Code Demos, above. 

For an ES5 usage demo see [ES5 Agular2-now](http://plnkr.co/edit/uxV781?p=preview).


#### Installation

Angular2-now is available on npm, jspm and Bower. 


    npm install angular2-now

    jspm install npm:angular2-now

    bower install angular2-now


To use this library, include it in your Angular 1.3 (or higher) project, ensuring that it loads before it's functions are used. `window.angular2now` gives you access to all the annotations. You can import the functions you need into each module that requires them, like this:

##### Babel/ES6

    var {Component, View, Inject} = angular2now;

or, if you've configured SystemJS correctly, you may be able to import like this

    import {Component, View, Inject} from 'angular2now';
    

##### ES5

    var Component = angular2now.Component;
    var View = angular2now.View;
    var Inject = angular2now.Inject;

Or, if you want all the angular2-now annotations available for use anywhere in your application without explicitly importing them, then you could try this

    angular.extend(window, angular2now)

Please note that to use the Angular 2 `@` notation, as shown in the examples below, such as `@Component` or `@View`, you will need to have a build workflow that uses Babel to transpile your ES6 code to plain ES5 JavaScript that your browser can understand. 


### Meteor Installation

    meteor add pbastowski:angular2-now
    

## API

### Using SetModule

- **SetModule** `( 'app', ['angular-meteor', 'my-other-module'] )`

This allows us to set the Angular 1 module name in which ll Components, Services, Filters and State configuration will be created by the annotations. The syntax is identical to Angular's own `angular.module`, see: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.module. Use `SetModule` in the same places where you would use `angular.module`.
 
> SetModule is currently equivalent and interchangeable with angular.module. However, using angular.module is deprecated and will be removed in favor of SetModule in a future release of angular2-now. Use SetModule from now on.
 
#### How does it work? 
angular.module() has been monkey-patched to remember the module name and then call the original angular.module function (and return its return value). 


### Name-spacing your app's providers

Creating a namespace for your Angular 1 providers is simple. Just change your use of SetModule from this

    SetModule('moduleName')

to this
 
    SetModule('nameSpace:moduleName')

The `nameSpace` portion will be used to automatically prefix all provider names within your application. For example

    
    SetModule('webshop:helpers');
    
    @Service({ name: "myService" })   // will create a service called "webshop_myService"
    
    @Inject(['myService'])  // the "webshop_" a prefix will be added automatically by the annotation

    @Inject(['$anyThing', '@otherComponent', 'booking_getDate'])  // these will not be prefixed
    

As shown above, angular2-now will also automatically prefix with the current name-space your @Injected dependencies that are not already prefixed with another namespace or prefixed with the special characters "$" (Angular's global services) and "@" (component controller injections, such as ngModel).

> Caveat: You can't use the underscore `_` character in naming your providers. This is because angular2-now uses it to separate the namespace from the provider name. If you need to use `_` in your provider names then don't use the name-spacing feature of angular2-now. 


**Why bother with name-spacing?**

Within a bootstrapped Angular 1 app, all module and provider names created must be unique. This is usually not a problem when you are the only one working on your app. 

In a larger company, however, it is common for two or more teams to be working on different parts of the same overall app. Often on different projects. They may be creating different parts of the company homepage, such as booking or webshop. Booking could have a provider called "getData" and webshop could have its own provider named "getData". Within an Angular 1 app this would create a clash, even if these providers were created in different modules. 

To prevent the clash a naming convention is used, which clearly separates the provider names in two different teams. For example, booking could name their "getData" provider "booking_getData" and webshop could call their "webshop_getData". In this way, all providers within the same Angular 1 bootstrapped app will be unique.
   

### ui-router support through @State

This is completely not Angular 2, but I love how easy it makes my routing.

You'll have to include ui-router in your app

Meteor:

    meteor add angularui:angular-ui-router
    
Bower:

    bower install angular-ui-router

And then add the `ui.router` dependency to your bootstrap module, like this
  
    SetModule('myApp', ['angular-meteor', 'ui.router']);

Then, you can simply annotate your component with the route/state info, like so 

```javascript
@State({name: 'defect', url: '/defect', defaultRoute: true})

@Component({selector: 'defect'})
@View({templateUrl: 'client/defect/defect.html'})
@Inject(['lookupTables'])
class defect { 
}
```

The `defaultRoute` property, if set to True, will make the annotated State the default for your app. That it, if the user types an unrecognised path into the address bar, or does not type any path other than the url of your app, they will be redirected to the defaultRoute. It is a bit like the old 404 not found redirect, except that in single page apps there is no 404. There is just the default page (or route).
 
In certain cases it may not be enough to just set `defaultRoute = True`. For example, consider a deep state tree, such as below
 
 State | URL | abstract | default
 ------|-----|----------|---------
 root  | ""  | true | no
 root.app | "/app" | true | no
 root.app.step1  | "/step1" | false | yes
 
The default state "root.app.step1" is the child of two abstract parent states, one of which has a URL. To get this to work as expected, you will need to set `defaultRoute = '/app/step1'`. This is because UI router appends all the parent states together to form the final URL, which in the above example is '/app' + '/step1' = '/app/step1'. 

> Setting `defaultRoute = true` only works for simple routes without parent states that have their own URLs. For nested states, where the default state has parent states with their own URLs, always specify the `defaultRoute` as a string that represents the final URL that you want the app to navigate to by default.


#### Resolving and injecting dependencies 

To add a `ui-router` resolve block, add it to the @State annotation as shown below.

```javascript
@State({
    name: 'defect', 
    url: '/defect', 
    defaultRoute: true,
    resolve: {
        user: function() { return 'paul'; },
        role: function() { return 'admin'; }
    }
})
```

A resolve block can also be added as a `static` property on the class itself, like shown below. Either way produces the same results.

```javascript
@State({ name: 'root', url: '' })
@Inject(['defect'])
class defect {
    constructor(defect) { 
        // defect.name == 'paul'
        // defect.role == 'admin'
    }
    static resolve = {
        user: function() { return 'paul'; },
        role: function() { return 'admin'; }
    }
}
```

The resolved values are made available for injection into a component's constructor, as shown above. The injected parameter `defect` is the name of a service created for you that holds the resolved return values. The name of this service is always the camelCased version of your component's selector. So, if the selector == 'my-app', then the name of the injectable service will be 'myApp'. 


#### States without a component
    
It is also possible to define a state without a component, as in

```javascript
@State({ 
    name: 'test', 
    url: '/test', 
    resolve: { 
        user: function() { return 'paul'; },
        role: function() { return 'admin'; } 
    } 
})
class myApp {
    constructor(user, role) {
        console.log('myApp resolved: ', user, role);
    }
}
```

In this case, the class constructor is the controller for the route and receives the injected properties directly.  


### Bootstrapping the app

#### `bootstrap (app [, config ])` 

This allows you to bootstrap your Angular 1 app using the Angular 2 component bootstrap syntax. So, there is no need to use `ng-app`. Using `bootstrap` is the equivalend of the Angular 1 manual bootstrapping method: `angular.bootstrap(DOMelement, ['app'])`. The bootstrap function also knows how to handle Cordova apps.
`config` is the same parameter as in angular.bootstrap: https://code.angularjs.org/1.3.15/docs/api/ng/function/angular.bootstrap. It can be used to enforce strictDi, for testing before deployment. 

Somewhere in your HTML add this:
```html
<my-app>Optional content inside my app that can be transcluded</my-app>
```
And in your JavaScript add the code below.  

```javascript
SetModule('my-app', []);

@Component({selector: 'my-app' })
@View({template: `<content></content>`})
class app { 
}

bootstrap(app);
```

In the example above, notice that the bootstrap module must have the same name as the bootstrap component's selector.


### ControllerAs
The created components use ControllerAs syntax. So, when referring to properties or functions on the controller's "scope", make sure to prefix them with `this` in the controller and with the `className`, or the camel-cased selector name if different from the className, in the HTML templates.

**What if I want to use "vm" as the name of my controller?**

No problem. Just configure angular2-now to use "vm" instead, like this

```javascript
angular2now.options({ controllerAs: 'vm' })
```

Do this before you use any angular2-now components!


### Transclude and `<content></content>`
If your inline template includes a `<content>` tag then `@View` will automatically add `ng-transclude` to it and the directive's transclude flag will be set to true.

Templates specified using the templateUrl property aren't currently checked and thus do not get `ng-transclude` added to them by `@View`. You will have to manually add ng-transclude to the element you want to transclude in your non-inline templates and also add `transclude: true` to the @View annotation's options, as shown below:

    @View({ templateUrl: '/client/mytemplate.html', transclude: true })


### Importing the required annotations from angular2-now

This package exports the object `angular2now` from which you can import the annotations that you need, like so:

```javascript
// Import the Angular2now annotations using ES6 destructuring assignment
// Look up ES6 destructuring here: https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/ 
var {Component, Template, Service, Filter, Inject, bootstrap} = angular2now;
```

or like this:

```javascript
// You can also do it like this
 var Component = angular2now.Component;
 var Template = angular2now.Template;
 ...
```

Alternatively, I have created a meteor package `pbastowski:require`, which allows you to write your imports like this

```javascript
import {Component, View, bootstrap} from 'angular2now';
```
 
> `pbastowski:require` does not implement RequireJS. It is only a little stub that allows you to write nicer looking import statements. 


### How do I access `ngModel` and other component's controllers?

You `@Inject` the names of the components whose controller you want, prefixed with `"@"` or `"@^"` (looks for a parent controller). Due to the nature of Angular 1 and Babel, these dependencies can not be directly injected into the constructor. However, they can be accessed within the constructor like this: 

```javascript
@Component({ selector: 'my-validator' })
@Inject(['@ngModel', '@^tabContainer'])
class myValidator {
    constructor() {
    
        this.$dependson = function (ngModel, tabContainer) {
            ngModel.$parsers.unshift(function (value) { ... });
            
            // This gives you access to tabContainer's scope methods and properties
            tabContainer.someFunction();
            if (tabContainer.tabCount === 0) { ... }
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that the injected component controllers are not listed as arguments to the constructor.

> Warning: This is a breaking change introduced in 0.1.7. The use of `this.ngModel = function(ngModel) { // do stuff with ngModel }` within the constructor is no longer supported. Please use the syntax shown above.


### Meteor Helper Annotations

#### `@MeteorMethod( ?options )`

The `@MeteorMethod` annotation is used to create a client-side method that calls a procedure defined on the Meteor server. The `options` argument is optional. Here is an example.

On the Server Side you create the Meteor method like this:

```javascript
Meteor.methods({
    sendEmail: function(from, to, subject, body) {
        try {
            Email.send({from: from, to: to, subject: subject, text: body});
        } catch (er) {
            return er;
        }
    }
})
```

On the Client Side, you annotate a stub method, in this case ` sendEmail(){} `, in your Service or Component class with ` @MeteorMethod() `. The name of the stub method must be the same as the name of the Meteor method on the server:
 
```javascript
class Mail {
   @MeteorMethod()
   sendEmail() { }
}
```
And then you call ` sendEmail() ` somewhere, like this:

```javascript
@Inject(['mail'])
class myComponent {
    constructor(mail) {
        mail.sendEmail('me@home.com', 'you@wherever.net', 'hello', 'Hi there!')
            .then( () => console.log('success'), (er) => console.log('Error: ', er) );
    }
}
```

#### `options` argument

`options` allows you to override global options on a per-method basis. These options are: 

Attribute | Type | Description
----------|------|-------------------
controllerAs | string | Allows you to specify a default controllerAs prefix to use for all components. The default prefix is the camel-cased version of the component's selector.   
spinner	| object | Exposes show() and hide() methods, that show and hide a busy-spinner
events	| object | Exposes beforeCall() and afterCall(), which will be called before and after the ajax call. Only `afterCall` is guaranteed to run after the call to the MeteorMethod completes.
noConflict | boolean | **false** = (default for version < 0.4.0) monkey-patch `angular.module`, **true** = don't monkey-patch  
For example, options can be defined at the global level like this:

```javascript
import {options} from 'angular2now';

angular2now.options({
    spinner: {
        show: function () { document.body.style.background = 'yellow'; },
        hide: function () { document.body.style.background = ''; }
    },
    events:  {
        beforeCall: () => console.log('< BEFORE call'),
        afterCall:  () => console.log('> AFTER call'),
    }
});

```

When defining a @MeteorMethod(), the options can be overridden like this:

```javascript
@MeteorMethod({ spinner: { ... }, events: { ... })
sendEmail() {}
```


### What environment is required?
- Angular 1.3+ 
- Babel 5.1.10+ (lower versions process annotations in the wrong order)
- Meteor 1.1.0.2

#### Browsers
- IE9+
- Chrome
- FireFox

### Examples

```javascript

// "Import" the angular2-now annotations and functions into local scope
var {Component, Template, Service, Filter, Inject, bootstrap} = angular2now;

// Use SetModule() to create the 'my-components' module for our components/directives.
// All components created with @Component, @Filter and @Service will automatically
// go into this module.
SetModule('my-components', []);

// The filter name is 'ucase'. You can use this like so: "'string' | ucase"
@Filter({ name: 'ucase' })
class filter1 {
    constructor (prefix) {
        return function(input) {
            return (input + '').toUpperCase();
        }
    }
}

// The name of the service that you can inject is 'service1'
@Service({ name: 'service1' })
class myService {
    // this service has no methods
    hello = 'this is'
    world = 'a test'
}

@Service({ name: 'service2' })
class otherService {
    hello = 'hello'
    world = 'world'
    test() {
        // this is a method in our service
        return this.hello + ' ' + this.world;
    }
}

@Component({
    // The name of the directive will be the camelCased version of the selector name.
    selector: 'file-change',
    
    // bind is the same as scope was in Angular 1

    bind: { fileChange: '&' }
})
class fileChange {
    constructor ($element, $scope) {
